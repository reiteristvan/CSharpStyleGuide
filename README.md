# C# Style Guide

## Purpose

If you are looking for an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions and structuring the source code of your C# based application then step right in. This article is based on my development experience and working in teams.

The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance writing correct, reusable and most importantly developer friendly source code. I'm going to explain why I choose to use these conventions.
